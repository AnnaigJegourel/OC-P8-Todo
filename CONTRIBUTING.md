# How to contribute

‚ú® Thank you for taking time to contribute to this project!

ü™™ It is released under the [MIT License](./LICENSE).

ü§ù Everyone is encouraged to participate, as long as you engage with consideration and respect and contribute in a positive and constructive way.

üèÅ First see the [README](./README.md) to have an overview of the project and to install it.

## Reporting a problem: good issues

### üîé If you spot a problem that should be fixed or have an idea to enhance the app, please first check if there is still an issue about it.

Issues can relate to fixing a bug, improving the code quality or the app performance, adding a new test or creating a new feature, enhancing the documentation... anything you may consider appropriate.

### üí° If the issue doesn't exist yet, please create it, writing a relevant title and clear explanations about your suggestion.

Using the labels (and also creating some if useful) can be convenient to help collaborating on the project.
Also providing as much context as you can may be very helpful, such as: screen shots, link to documentation,
and of course, specifying which file(s) should be updated / which feature would be impacted by the change.
